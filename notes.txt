each thing is a calculation:

    operator :"-";
    solution: 8
}

POST /calculations{
    firstNumber: 12,
    secondNumber: 4,
    operator: "-"
}

GET /calculations
[
    {
        firstNumber: 12,
        secondNumber: 4,
        operator: "-"
    },
    {
        firstNumber: 12,

ajax is a HTTP Request with url

chrome tools in headers with data passed to POST..

HTTP is a convention for network request.
